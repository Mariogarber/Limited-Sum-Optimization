# Limited-Sum Optimization

**Repository:** [Mariogarber / Limited-Sum-Optimization](https://github.com/Mariogarber/Limited-Sum-Optimization)  
**Main language:** Python  
**Purpose:** To find the most optimized strategy to win the Limited-Sum game.

## Description

The **Limited-Sum Optimization** project aims to determine the optimal strategy for a mathematical or game-theoretical problem where players make limited sum choices under specific constraints.  
It explores different approaches and algorithms to optimize outcomes, simulating the decision process and evaluating which strategies lead to the highest success rate or payoff.

The repository is fully implemented in Python and designed to be modular, allowing different strategies and configurations to be tested easily.

## Objective

This project is part of a competitive quiz organized among all students of our master’s program.  
Each participant was required to **design the rules of the game and develop the most effective strategy to outperform their classmates**.  
The challenge encouraged creativity, mathematical reasoning, and algorithmic design to build a system capable of finding the best move in any given game scenario.  

The goal of this specific project is to implement and optimize strategies for the *Limited-Sum* game, aiming to discover the most successful approach against all other students’ strategies.

## Structure Description

The repository is organized into several main components that separate logic, strategies, and execution:

- **`game/`**  
  Contains the main game logic, rules, and simulation mechanisms.  
  It defines how the limited-sum game operates and manages the flow of interactions between strategies.

- **`strategies/`**  
  Includes different strategy implementations that can be applied to the game.  
  Each file or class represents a unique optimization approach, allowing comparison of their performance.

- **`main.py`**  
  Serves as the entry point of the program.  
  It initializes the game, selects strategies, and runs simulations to evaluate which performs best.

- **`requirements.txt`**  
  Lists all Python dependencies needed to run the project.
